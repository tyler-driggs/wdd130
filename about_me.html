    <img src = "Images/IMG_1514.jpg" alt="Me in a hat" width = 200>
    <p>My name is Tyler Driggs. I spent most of my childhood in the Chicago, IL area then moved to Phoenix AZ when I was in 8th grade.
    I love philosophical inquiries and reading. My favorite book right now is Walden by Henry David Thoreau. I also enjoy video games, watching and playing football. I am a Computer Science major with this semester being my first semester at BYU-I. Needless to say I am very excited and can't wait to see what is in store.  </p>
